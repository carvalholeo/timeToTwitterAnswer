    <article class="my-5">
      <p>How much time it necessary to answer support ask? 1 day? 1 week? I don't know. I just know that I'm asking for long-time support from Twitter, and until now I have not any answer from them. Even the public departments, as Correios (postal service), and Detran (Vehicles Department) have answered me, but not Twitter.</p>
      <p>I did official support asks, through form on Help Center, and for @TwitterSupport, @Twitter and @TwitterBrasil accounts too, but I don't have anything.</p>
      <p>So, I decided to create this page, that says how many time I'm waiting for some response from the Twitter team. Maybe, I'll be banned from their platform, but I still show everyone their disrespect for their users.</p>
